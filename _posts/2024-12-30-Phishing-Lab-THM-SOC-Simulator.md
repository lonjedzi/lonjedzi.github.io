Phishing attacks are a constant threat in cybersecurity, requiring precise analysis to combat. In this post, I explore TryHackMe’s SOC Simulator and its Phishing Unfolding scenario.

In this lab, we dive into a live phishing attack, monitoring real-time alerts, identifying key malicious activities like PowerShell executions and reverse shell connections, and documenting the attack’s full scope in a detailed report. Join me as I walk through this hands-on experience and share insights on tackling phishing attacks in a corporate environment.

### Scenario Objectives

1. Monitor and analyze real-time alerts as the attack unfolds.

2. Identify and document critical events such as PowerShell executions, reverse shell connections, and suspicious DNS requests.

3. Create detailed case reports based on your observations to help the team understand the full scope of the breach.
