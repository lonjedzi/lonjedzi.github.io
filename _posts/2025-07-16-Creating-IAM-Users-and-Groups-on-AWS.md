## Introduction
It's Day 1 of my AWS Cloud Practitioner 30-Day Study Challenge, and I’m starting with one of the core services in AWS: Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM helps control who can access what in your AWS environment, which is crucial for both security and team collaboration.
In this project, I create a user group, assign it administrator permissions, create a new IAM user, add that user to the group, and then log in using the new account. It’s a simple process, but it lays the foundation for secure AWS access and good account management practices.
This blog post walks you through each step I take, with clear explanations to help you follow along even if you’re just getting started.

🧱 ## Prerequisites
Before I begin, here’s what I need to have in place:
✅ An AWS Free Tier account
✅ Access to the AWS Management Console
✅ A stable internet connection
✅ A bit of curiosity and a willingness to learn by doing

No advanced setup or prior AWS experience is necessary. As long as I have access to the console, I’m ready to go.

🔹 ## Step 1: Navigate to the IAM Service
We start by logging into the AWS Management Console using our root account (don’t worry—we’ll stop using it after this setup).

Once we’re in, we go to the search bar at the top and type “IAM”. From the dropdown, we select IAM (Identity and Access Management).

This takes us to the IAM dashboard, where we’ll manage users, groups, and permissions throughout this project.

🔹 ## Step 2: Create a User Group
Now that we’re inside the IAM dashboard, we begin by creating a user group. This helps us manage permissions more easily by assigning them to a group instead of individual users.

We click on “User groups” in the sidebar, then hit the “Create group” button.
For the Group name, we type Admin-Demo since we want this group to have full administrative access.

Next, we scroll down to Attach permissions policies. From the list, we search for and select AdministratorAccess. This gives the group permission to perform any action on any AWS resource.

Once that’s done, we scroll to the bottom and click “Create group”.
Our admin group is now ready!

🔹 ## Step 3: Create a New IAM User
With our group ready, we now create the actual user account that we’ll use for logging in.

We head over to the “Users” section in the sidebar and click on “Add users”.

Here, we enter a username. We will go with Mr-Demo for this example.
Under Access type, we check the option that says “AWS Management Console access” so the user can sign in through the browser.

We choose “Autogenerated password” for the password type, and once that’s set, we click “Next” to move on to adding the user to a group.

🔹 ## Step 4: Add the User to the Admin Group
Now that we’ve set up the user details, it’s time to give them the right permissions.

On the “Set permissions” page, we choose “Add user to group”.
We should see the Admin-Demo group we created earlier, so we go ahead and check that box.

This step ensures our user inherits the administrator access policy we attached to the group. No need to assign policies manually to the user — keeping it clean and manageable.

Once we’ve selected the group, we hit “Next” to review everything before finalizing.

🔹 ## Step 5: Create the User and Log In
We’ve reviewed the setup — now let’s bring this user to life.
We click “Create user” and just like that, AWS gives us the sign-in link, the username, and a password for our new IAM user.

<img width="1361" height="545" alt="16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2df754b8-f351-4cc4-bef6-28388eeeec01" />
We copy those details, and then open a private/incognito window or another user in our browser. This lets us log in as the new user without interfering with our root session.

We paste the sign-in link into the new window, enter the username and the password we just copied, then hit Sign In.

Boom — we’re in! Logged in as our new IAM user with full admin rights. From here on out, we’ll be using this user for our AWS work — much safer than using the root account.

## Conclusion
We’ve just completed a hands-on walk-through of creating an IAM user, assigning them to a group, and logging in with that user. This is a core skill that we’ll keep building on as we move forward.

## Extra Notes:
We used IAM for this task, but AWS is encouraging the use of IAM Identity Center for advanced access management. We'll explore that later.
Giving full admin access was fine for this lab, but in real-world setups, we should follow the Principle of Least Privilege.
Make sure to store the generated password safely, as it won’t be visible again.

## Key Takeaways:
✅ IAM allows us to manage users and their permissions in AWS.
✅ Using groups makes it easier to assign permissions to multiple users.
✅ It’s best practice to avoid using the root account for daily operations.
